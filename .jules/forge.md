### 2026-04-11 - WeakEvent Subscription in Core Bridge
- **Discovery**: Custom `WeakEvent` implementation in the Core uses `.AddListener()` and `.RemoveListener()` instead of the standard `+=` and `-=` operators or `.Subscribe()` / `.Unsubscribe()`. Always verify the specific custom utilities provided by the Core before trying to attach standard C# event handler logic.

### 2026-04-11 - UI Placement in Godot 4.6.1
- **Discovery**: When placing `Control` nodes directly inside a `Node2D` hierarchy (world space), they correctly follow the world coordinates and are affected by the camera. Wrapping them in a `CanvasLayer` detaches them from world coordinates and pins them to screen space.
- **Quirk**: Input events for UI elements (like `Button` clicks) can be absorbed or ignored if the UI is deep in the game world tree and obscured by collision/mouse filters of sibling `Node2D`/`Area2D`s. Placing global interactive menus (like `NavigationMenu`) into the main scene's `CanvasLayer` guarantees they are at the forefront of the viewport and reliably intercept mouse events.

### Navigation Menu Fixes & Level Architecture
- Extracted the Player from base maps and put them directly in `Level{X}.tscn` scenes.
- Created `PlayerHub.tscn` to load `base_map_island.tscn` cleanly.
- `NavigationManager` now uses `SceneLoadingManager` for loading.
- Re-routed all portal interactions to spawn portals near player or just remain static at the Home location, updating `IsPlayerHome` check to check `SessionState`.
### 2026-04-12 - Auto-Active Portal for Map Return
- **Feature**: Portals in any island maps that are not the `PlayerHub` will now be automatically activated.
- **Discovery**: Godot allows retrieving `GetTree()?.CurrentScene?.SceneFilePath` during `_Ready()` of any node inside the active scene. We leverage this to conditionally invoke `ActivatePortal(IslandDestination.HomeIsland)` right when the portal loads, allowing the portal to permanently serve as a return point back to the home hub.

### 2026-04-12 - Navigation System Architecture Documentation
- **Tags**: Navigation, Système, Architecture
- **Decision**: Created an exhaustive End-to-End documentation for the Navigation System (`WikiCode/SystemeNavigation.md`).
- **Learning**: The Navigation System successfully demonstrates the N-Tier architecture and Bridge pattern, ensuring Core logic (`NavigationService`) generates destinations and calculates costs abstractly. Interaction via Godot Nodes (`NavigationMenu`, `PortalInteraction`) triggers WeakEvents which are intercepted by Godot Singletons (`NavigationManager`) to persist state before deferring transition to `SceneLoadingManager`. This ensures stable decoupling between game state persistence and scene lifecycles.

- **Godot Save Migration & Paths:** Godot's `res://` maps directly to `Src/IslandSurvivor/`. To resolve a path back to the solution root programmatically within Godot, `ProjectSettings.GlobalizePath("res://../../Save/")` successfully breaks out of the Godot project bounds, pointing directly alongside the `.sln`. Using `DirAccess` and `FileAccess` is necessary to gracefully interact with these paths over raw `System.IO` to respect virtual directories (`user://`).
